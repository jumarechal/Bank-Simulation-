# SAMUFluvialSimulation

This project aims to simulate the functioning of the Manaus river SAMU. The objective was to first create a model as close as possible 
to the real system so that it could be used to study different scenarios. 

You will find the simulation of the current system in 'boat simulation run one time' which allows the launch of a single simulation. 
The 'boat simulation multiple run' allows several simulations to be run at the same time and the results of the various simulations to 
be analysed. Finally 'boat simulation different scenarios' is the study of the different scenarios we have put in place. 

The principle is the same with 'boat clustering' which is a proposed improvement of the current system. We have therefore defined 
clusters allowing us to have boats closer to the different communities.
